# workout-tracker

Backward engineered an existing front-end by creating an express & mongoose backend.
I created a workout.js schema based on the provided seed data.
The public folder gave hints about what HTML routes are necessary in order to run the app.

The necessary api routes are based on the calls the frontend made (public *.js files)

I was left a little confused about some front-end functionality and believe there are some issues on that end.
